Problems to solve<br>
In order to optimize business processes, the customer needed to implement a system for automatically generating license keys 
for their product.<br><br>

Solutions<br>
Using Spring Boot, we quickly developed a license server that is responsible for creating, converting, and encrypting keys, 
and created a graphical interface that allows managers to easily create and delete keys, track the number of keys created, 
their validity period, status, and other characteristics.<br><br>
