Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) is a graphical language for constructing models of concurrent systems and analysing their properties. 
Typical application domains are data networks, distributed algorithms, business processes, manufacturing systems, and 
multi-agent systems.
We took part in the development of a new version of the program for editing, simulating, and analyzing Colored Petri nets.
