Problems to solve<br><br>
The client representing one of the universities in the Netherlands offered us to participate in the development of a new version of 
the program designed to model and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems with the use of the so-called Colored Petri Nets (CPN). 
In order to implement the new features and make their use more convenient, it became necessary to redesign the user interface.<br><br>

Solutions<br><br>
The development process was split into several phases and involved weekly video-conferences with the client for conducting incremental 
delivery of the new features, refinements, plannings and clarifying the requirements.<br><br>
As a result, with the use of the Electron framework we have created a cross-platform application that includes the following components:<br><br>
<li>a stand-alone server providing validation and simulation of models created by a user;</li>
<li>a graphical user interface that is more modern than the previous one and can implement new functions of the CPN IDE.</li><br><br>
