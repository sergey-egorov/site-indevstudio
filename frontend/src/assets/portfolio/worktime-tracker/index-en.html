Problems to solve<br><br>
The client, a fast food restaurant chain, reached out to us with a request to develop an application for monitoring employee time. 
The application must be able to record the time an employee arrives at/leaves the workplace. To detect who is clocking in for, 
and out from, a job, the client wanted the facial recognition technology to be used.<br><br>

Solutions<br><br>
Having analyzed the clientâ€™s needs, we built a solution comprising of the following components:<br><br>
<li>Android application for a tablet located at the entrance and recording the workplace arrival and departure times. To verify 
the employee's identity, we have used the facial recognition technology from our partner, Speech Technology Center.</li><br>
<li>A server with a database for storing information about employees, which interacts with the application, compares biometric data, 
creates and stores records about the working hours of employees.</li><br>
<li>Desktop application based on Angular, which allows an administrator to configure and manage the list of employees, change their 
data, ensure synchronization with the mobile app, and view records about the arrival/departure times of employees.</li><br><br>
