Problems to solve<br><br>
While working on various projects, we noticed that many clients have a need in a tool for creating a custom automated 
telephony system. Having analyzed the market, we found out that there are not many ready-made solutions in this area and challenged 
ourselves to develop one that would allow clients using it to customize voice service on their own and, most importantly, do it in 
a simple, seamless and convenient manner. <br><br>
The main challenges were to create a server that would directly manage the call and execute scripts for processing incoming/outgoing 
calls, and to develop a user-friendly interface  with clear options for creating and customizing voice services.<br><br>

Solutions<br><br>
Having thought over the application architecture, we chose Asterisk as the virtual PBX and Spring Boot to create the server.
The development of the interface was the most difficult task. Our goal was to create an intuitive interface that would allow a user 
with no programming knowledge to create a scenario using visual graphical elements and easily launch a voice service based on it.<br><br>
At the same time, we wanted the interface to have additional options providing, for example, the ability to send various http requests 
and SQL queries, which significantly expands the functionality of the voice service and makes the scenario more flexible. Keeping that 
in mind, we make it possible to extend the scenario by adding JavaScript scripts, the use of which allows you to maximize the potential 
of the application.<br><br>
