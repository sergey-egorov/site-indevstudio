Problems to solve<br><br>
The client representing a large production facility asked us to develop a solution to automate record keeping of the devices 
received for repairing. Until then, each step in a repair process was recorded in electronic spreadsheets manually, which was 
inconvenient, time-consuming and made a mess in the workflow.<br>
The clientâ€™s idea was to use bar-code markings that would be applied to a device and contain all the necessary information about 
manipulations made with the device and its movements from employee to employee.<br><br>

Solutions<br><br>
To implement the client's idea, we have developed a hardware and software complex that includes a tablet, a barcode scanner connected 
to the tablet via micro USB, and an Android application for processing and storing scanned barcodes. So now the actions of employees 
concerning record keeping of the devices are reduced to sticking barcodes on them. Scanning barcodes for entering data into the app 
is performed by a single employee without interfering in the repair workflow.<br><br>
