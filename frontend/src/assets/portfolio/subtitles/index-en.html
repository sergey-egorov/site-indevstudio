Problems to solve<br>
The client, a TV broadcaster, reached out to us with a need for a subtitle creation tool that would make it much easier and faster 
to generate subtitles for telecasts. Until then, subtitles were made manually without the use of specialized software. As a consequence, 
there was a significant time lag between the broadcast and the video stream generated in real time. The client's need was to reduce 
the lag by using the minimum possible amount of technical and human resources.<br><br>

Solutions<br>
The scope of work included developing a cross-platform application with the following features:<br>
<ul>
  <li>receiving media stream and audio information retrieval from it,</li>
  <li>speech recognition and transforming voice data into text form,</li>
  <li>displaying a transcript with timestamps,</li>
  <li>automatic subtitles generation in the required format</li>
  <li>automatic translation of subtitles into another language,</li>
  <li>inserting the created subtitles into the broadcast video stream,</li>
  <li>a convenient, user-friendly interface with clear options for editing subtitles (unfortunately, editing can not be avoided 
  in any way).</li>
  <li>displaying visual timeline and soundwave for controlling and adjusting the speed and duration of the subtitles</li>
</ul>
Having analyzed the clientâ€™s needs, our team decided to use the cloud service we had created for one of our previous projects for 
speech recognition and automatic translation into another language. Based on Spring Boot and Java, we have created a standalone 
server to provide video streaming, audio processing, and speech-to-text functions.
After some sessions with the client on how the user interface should be organized, we clearly defined what to be achieved and 
built it quite fast and effectively with the use of the Angular platform. To make subtitle editing as quick and easy as possible, 
we have added a set of keyboard shortcuts that duplicate the main functions of the GUI.<br><br>
