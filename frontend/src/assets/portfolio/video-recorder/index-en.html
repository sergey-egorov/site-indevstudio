Problems to solve<br><br>
The client reached out to us with a request to create an application that could provide remote control over the operation of 
the video recorder from a mobile device (a smartphone or a tablet).

Solutions<br><br>
We have developed an Android application with a bilingual interface. Interaction between the app and the video recorder is performed 
using the REST API. <br>
The main features of the app are:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>connection to the video recorder via wifi / gsm;</li>
    <li>setting up the start of the video recorder operation by an acoustic signal or motion detection;</li>
    <li>setting up a schedule for starting video and audio recording;</li>
    <li>managing video streaming;</li>
    <li>configuring settings of the video recording;</li>
    <li>providing export / import of video and audio recordings;</li>
    <li>storing / deleting audio and video recordings;</li>
    <li>detecting geolocation.<br><br></li>
</ul>
