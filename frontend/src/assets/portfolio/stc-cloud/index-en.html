Problems to solve<br><br>
In close cooperation with our partner, Speech Technology Center, we had been developing a cloud platform to provide speech synthesis 
and recognition technology. In the next stage of development, our team was offered to create a paid service that would allow developers 
to access the platform's technologies and use them in their products.<br><br>

Solutions<br><br>
To implement the service, we create an API that allows clients to use speech synthesis and recognition capabilities in their own products, 
as well as a web portal providing the option for automatic payments for the service. <br>
We used Spring Boot, Angular, Jbilling, and Swagger as the main technologies for building the service.<br><br>
