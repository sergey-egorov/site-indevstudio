Problems to solve<br>
The client, a company selling mobile devices, implemented a trade-in program in its business process. 
To speed up the trade-in process and determine consistent and fair values for consumer devices, they needed an
automated diagnostic tool that could carry out evaluation of the working and physical condition of a device.<br><br>

Solutions<br>
The work started with several collaboration sessions with the client during which we discussed the scope of features to be developed, clarify 
product requirements and plan the development roadmap. To meet the requirements, we have developed a solution combining the following components:<br><br>
<li>A mobile app for Android/iOS that performs diagnostics of software and hardware functions of a mobile device. The app checks 
a device for several dozen parameters and transmits the results to the central system.</li><br>
<li>A web portal consisting of two modules:</li>
- a front-end Angular application, <br>
- a standalone back-end application in Java created with the use of the Spring Boot library and having a database. <br>
The web portal is used for registering parameters of mobile device diagnostics sessions and automatically generating quick and accurate
condition reports for tested devices and other necessary documentation for providing trade-in service.<br><br>
<li>A server application that centrally manages mobile device diagnostics points.</li><br>
