Problems to solve<br><br>
In preparation for the presentation of a new product from our partner, Speech Technology Center, we were offered to develop 
a demo application for mobile devices that could demonstrate the possibilities of using voice biometrics as an on-board technology 
for mobile devices.<br><br>

Solutions<br><br>
To show the potential of our partner’s new voice recognition technology, we chose to create a banking app. To start using the app, 
a user must pass the registration procedure that includes creating a voice model. After that, the functions of conducting banking 
transactions initiated by the voice become available. For example, to make a money transfer, the only thing a user needs to do is 
to voice who and what sum he or she wants to remit. The transaction is completed only in case of successful user’s voice identification.<br><br>
