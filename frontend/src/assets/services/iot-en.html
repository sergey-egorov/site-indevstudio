The main idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to equip objects with a technology that allows them 
to communicate with each other without human participation. <br>
<br>
IoT can make our lives easier by turning physical objects into active participants in business 
processes and helpers in our daily life routine.<br>
<br>
It is possible to control IoT devices from a distance and exchange data in real time without human-to-human or 
human-to-computer interaction and, thus, to perform work and household chores more quickly and efficiently.<br>
<br>
IoT finds many applications in both services sector and industrial settings. Regardless of the goal, the implementation 
of a particular IoT system is associated with the following tasks: device management, data collection and analysis, 
and deployment of mobile cloud services.<br>
<br>
We can find an IoT-based solution that completely covers the range of your tasks.
