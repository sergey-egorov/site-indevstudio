A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.[1] Such programs are
often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, although as of 2019, they
are far short of being able to pass the Turing test.[2] Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various
practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition.
