Natural language processing (NLP) is the technology referring to Conversational AI Solutions. NLP enable human-machine interaction to occur 
in the natural way.<br>

A natural language processing integrated into IVR is able to perform a spoken language analysis and based on its results deliver an appropriate 
response to users. By intelligently processing natural speech input, the system can determine the intent of the userâ€™s message without a live agent.<br>
