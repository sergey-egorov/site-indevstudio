The brain of a website or app is its backend. While web design provides the interface for the user 
to work with the system, information processing, calculations, business logic, database interactions, 
external system communication and many other functions are handled by the back end system.<br>
<br>
We offer back-end solutions for mobile, web, desktop, and IoT systems, from small sites to heavily 
loaded multi-user applications, with high-performance requirements.<br>
<br>
As a server part we use Spring Boot library in Java which easily provides a REST or WebSocket interface.
