Application porting means changing, transfer and adaptation of a software app for use in a different environment. Despite the transformation, 
the previous functionality of the program remains unaffected while some additional benefits can be achieved due to the options of a new platform.<br>
<br>
The reasons for porting apps and libraries may be the need to expand the capabilities of the software solution, improve its market position, and 
increase the competitiveness of the application.<br>

We offer services for porting libraries and mobile apps to the platform you need.
