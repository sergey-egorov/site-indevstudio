In many cases centralized computing is ineffective and costly in the context of increasing data and workloads.<br>
<br>
If you need an application that is capable to withstand high load and handle large data flows, then distributed system
is what you need. The main feature of distributed system is sharing activities and resources among multiple components
(servers).<br>
<br>
It has more computational power than centralized computing systems.
We can built complex distributed systems of various scales from server software to consumer app for different operating
systems and hardware platform.
